                <p>The Agouti gene determines whether a cat's coat will have banded hairs (agouti pattern) or be solid in color. The A allele produces banded hairs, leading to tabby patterns (mackerel, classic, or ticked), while the a allele leads to a solid color, without the banding.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The White Spotting gene causes some cats to have white patches or areas, typically on the chest, paws, belly, and face. This gene is responsible for the bicolor or tuxedo pattern where the cat has a mix of colored fur and white patches. White spotting (ws) patterns are extremely variable. A cat with a single copy of ws can have a small or a large amount of white. Anecdotally, cats with 2 copies of ws tend to have more white, and may even be solid white. Selective breeding can fix the amount of white because other genes, known as polygenes, can influence colour distribution e.g. some breeds have been fixed for gloves or mitts.</p>

                <p>PKD is a hereditary condition in cats, especially Persians, that causes fluid-filled cysts to develop in the kidneys, potentially leading to kidney failure. The PKD1 gene (located on chromosome 2) is responsible for the development of this disease. Cats with PKD1 mutations are more likely to develop PKD.</p>
                <p>In the fancy cat breeds, PKD1 is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition. This implies that only one copy of the altered version of the gene is required to produce PKD1. Generally, 50% of PKD1 positive cats' offspring will inherit PKD1.</p>

                <p>Polydactylism is a genetic trait where a cat has extra toes (more than the typical five on each front paw). The Polydactyl gene is typically a dominant trait, so cats with one copy of the gene (e.g., Pp) can exhibit polydactylism.</p>
                <p>Polydactyly is inherited as an autosomal dominant gene defect, sometimes with variable gene penetration. Recent work has shown that the defect is generally the same in cats as in humans.</p>

                <p><strong>Green eyes:</strong> This eye color is seen in many cats, and while it's not fully understood, it is often linked to coat color and breed.
